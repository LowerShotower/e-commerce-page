First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
Here is a demo of an e-commerce search page that is available on Vercel. Tailwind, module.scss, and styled-components were pre-installed, and a combination of Tailwind and styled-components was used for the styling to see how they work together. This made it possible to avoid generating lots of custom styles. The store was not installed as it is not needed for the demo.

Since everything was uploaded to Vercel, Docker is not required.

I chose to use a mocked database file instead of MongoDB.
